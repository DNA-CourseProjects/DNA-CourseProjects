## 1. Description: A high-level description of the nature of the problem you
are trying to tackle and the models, methods and/or approaches you will employ
to address it. Also impor- tant is to describe what data you are going to use,
how/from where you will obtain them and what is their nature like the number of
available samples, number & types of features, number & types of
targets/outputs, etc.

The problem of recommendation systems and social media network analysis is one
that many advertisers would gladly invest much time and effort into in order to
gain an edge on the competition. In the field of neural networks, architectures
such as MLPs could be used with reasonable effectiveness to preform predictions
on graphs. However, a new approach involving Graph Neural Networks could yield
better results for this specific task, as well as for many different tasks in
the future.

For this project, the data that will be used will be primarily graph-based,
meaning that it will have a matrix representation in the form of adjacency
matrices or adjacency lists. Social media graphs and in general, graphs
obtained from reputable sources internet are plentiful (particularly in [Stanford's Large
Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/#socnets)) and as a
result, they could be used from such sources or collected perhaps using some web-scraping
technologies such as Python's BeautifulSoup library. The number of features
from the data will depend partially on the relevance of such features. Perhaps
an ablation study of sorts could be performed to determine which features are
useful, or perhaps some other study would be appropriate.

## 2. Expected Scope: A paragraph (or so) that briefly describes all tasks that
you are planning to perform for your project along with a time line featuring
major milestones of your effort. You may also want to point out, which task(s)
you anticipate to pose challenges to you and, if so, what type of challenges
and how do plan to overcome them.

What I am planning to perform for this project is to analyze the provided data
and show the effects of using a graph neural network on social networks for
different kinds of predictions. Of particular interest is edge-level
prediction, which could easily be applied for use in friend suggestions and
recommendation systems.

The timeline for this project will involve Spring Break, by which I will have
selected and/or collected my primary data source, then the end of March, by
which I will have experimented with different Graph Neural Network
architectures, and decided on some models which have performed well. Then, I
will

I anticipate the task of training to be of difficulty due to dimensionality of
the data. To avoid such difficulties, I plan on procuring extra resources for
future ML use cases, such as a Google Collab subscription. In addition, one
other difficulty might be storing the data and querying it, which could involve
the use of a graph database.

## 3. Expected Outcomes: A paragraph (or so) that briefly describes the
outcomes you expect to eventually produce/achieve. Also describe how you will
measure the success of your ICP effort.

The measure of success of the ICP effort will be determined mainly by the
success of a graph neural network at predicting the characteristics of the graph.

Another aspect of this involves the the breadth of the techniques used to make
predictions about the graph. Some examples of this involve the representation
of the graph, the loss function, and the network architectures. Regarding that
last topic, there are three approaches to Graph Neural Networks that are
specific to Graph Neural Networks: recurrent GNN's Spatial Convolutional GNN's
Spectral Convolutional GNN's. At the very least, the success of the project
will involve exploring at least one of these in depth and implementing it.

## 4. Key References: A few key references that you plan to rely on for your
initial investigation of your topic.
